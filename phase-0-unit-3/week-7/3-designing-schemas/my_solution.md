## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling:

For the one to one, I modeled a person and each person owns their own body and its parts.

I modeled the path of cars from manufacturer to customer. Everything starts at the manufacturer which then goes to the dealer and then finally the customer.

## Release 5: Reflection

I'm not a big fan of design assignments, but this one was ok. In terms of databases, designing holds a crucial role in making sure everything works correctly. There can be so much information to keep track of and if you dont have a plan, then things will go wrong and not turn out as expected. I enjoyed this assignment also because it was a nice break from the last two which took a good amount of time.

# Databases, SQL, and Schemas

You've played with classes quite a bit at this point. Have you ever thought of storing data about a specific thing, for example, songs and playlists in a database? Wouldn't that be a nice change? This week you get to start looking at SQL and database relationships.

If you aren't familiar with databases, please take some time to watch the videos listed in the resources (below) before working through the challenges.

Make sure to attend GPS 3.1 this week! Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/intro-gps-signup.md) to sign up.

## Submitting your work
**You need to submit your work through on [apply.devbootcamp.com](http://apply.devbootcamp.com) by Sunday at 11:59pm. When you log in, look at your profile page. There is a "Unit 3 Week 7 Submission" form.**

We use the submission form to gather feedback on our curriculum, so please answer the questions honestly to help us make the program better.

## Remember your expectations for the unit!
- Pair at least twice each week.  (You need to pair 6 times this unit).
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. You need to submit at least 7 pieces of feedback in this unit. (6 for peer-pairing, and 1 GPS)
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) per week on Socrates. You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit.

## Fork this repo
This week you will be storing your reflections in the challenge files in this repository.

## Fetching Changes
Sometimes we will make changes to the original repository to clarify instructions. You will need to fetch these changes from the master branch when we announce changes on the google+ community. Use these instructions. Substitute phase-0-unit-3 for each instance of phase-0-unit-1 in the instructions.

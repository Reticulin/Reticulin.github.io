### Reflection

So far I am enjoying learning and practicing SQL. These excercises helped to refresh me on the previous assignment and put what I've learned into practice a little bit all the while learning new methods and syntax. I can already see how SQL became such a needed feature in many programs past and present. I look forward to learning more.

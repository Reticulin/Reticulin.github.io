## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.

Well one of the first things that I noticed was that there was no DOCTYPE set for the page. Other than that oversight, the site seems to keep up to good website practices. The developer made it so there wasn't really any non-essential syntax cluttering up his/her code. So far I've been using a lot of divs, but this person didn't really use any and kept things simple and efficient.

 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? 

I know the developer used the classes properly, however I'm not sure on the id's for the spans since they are all different and have no mention on the css sheet.

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.

The thing is that the developer didnt really use many tags outside of tables. With the few tags they used other than tables, turned out fine in my opinion. 
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.

The authors used the 'span' tag to handle their formatting. <span class="pagetop"><a href="newslogin?whence=%6e%65%77%73">login</a>
</span>
 
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what?

I didn't really understand using span with id's to set vote scores such as <span id="down_8164523">
</span></center>.
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?

I felt the css file was very well organized and it flowed well in my opinion. I want to even say it was pleasant to look at.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?

I didn't notice any responsive design for the website at all.
 
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read?

The authors wanted to create something simple but efficient. I felt that they succeeded in this goal and have a good website. It functions well and is coded well. They could work on making it more responsive for different platforms and screen sizes, other than that, there is not much that I would change.



Reflection

My first hurdle I had to tackle when going into this assignment was to figure out how to make this code more readable. I had to research ways to break up the code into a more readable format and sublime's option wasn't really helping much. Once broken up, I was able to read and go through it easier and understand it more.

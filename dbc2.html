	<h1>The Three Colors of Starfleet</h1>
	<p> Whenever you see <span>"Star Trek"</span>, do you ever wonder why everyone wears a certain color shirt? I'm here to help answer that very question. For this, I am using the old Star Trek and the newest one(which is a remake of the old) as my examples.

	<h1>The Yellow Shirts</h1>
	<p>The yellow shirts represent 3 different roles on the ship. We have the <span>captain</span> of course who leads his/her crew and is in charge of the entire ship. The <span>pilot</span> who flies the ship is also graced with wearing the yellow shirt. We then come to the person or persons involved in setting courses and guiding the ship which falls under the role of <span>navigation</span>.

	<h1>The Red Shirts</h1>
	<p>The red shirts are perhaps the most common uniform among most of the crew. First we have the <span>engineers</span> which maintain the ship's integrity and functionality. There are those who fit within the role of <span>communication</span>. There are those who protect the safety and well being of the crew and they fall under the <span>security</span> role. Finally we have <span>operations</span> which pretty much handles everything else not mentioned.

	<h1>The Blue Shirts</h1>
	<p>The blue shirts are reserved for only 2 roles on a ship. There are the <span>science</span> officers and crew members which handle everything from examining new species to surveying anomalies and stars. The <span>medical</span> staff represent the 2nd lue shirt role. The medical staff has the responsibilty of keeping the crew as healthy as can be. It is up to them to have the crew maintain a healthy lifestyle and cure them of any ailments.

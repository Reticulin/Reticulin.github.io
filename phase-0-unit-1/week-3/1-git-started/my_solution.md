## Release 6: Reflection

I actually preferred using the command console for git rather than the app from the start of DBC. Just felt that I had more control with the console. Most of these commands were already known to me, but its good to get a refresher and look up specific definitions for each. Practice is the best way to learn and since I have to do work from 2 computers, I had a lot of practice.

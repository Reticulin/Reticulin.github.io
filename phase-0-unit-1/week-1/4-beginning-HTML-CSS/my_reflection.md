## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

One thing that I love about html is that it's simple and easy to pick up. I have yet to come accross something in html that doesn't make sense.

It's simplicity is both good and bad. You can only do so much with something simple. You require complexity for bigger and more ambitious tasks.

I went into this dreading the css part of the assignment. I love html, but hadn't really dabbled in css (I guess I was a little scared). This assignment forced me to learn more about it and I learned a great deal. I now see the importance of css and how useful it is.

The resources given were not sufficient enough (sorry), however I used this site in the past and I used it again today. That site is "w3schools.com". It's a great resource for java, html and css.

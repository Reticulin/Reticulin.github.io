## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I learned what exactly a "domain" was and I learned a good amount about DNS (Althoigh I feel I have much more to learn).

When you're setting up your html, you need to remember to always close the sections of the code (ie. <html></html>)

It's always a good feeling to see your web page live, but I have done it serveral times before (Will always and forever feel good to see it open).

My "aha" moment was when I found out that I can just edit files on my computer locally and then just sync them up with GitHub.

Didn't need any other resources for this assignment other than those provided by said assignment.

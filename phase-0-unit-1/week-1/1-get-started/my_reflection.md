* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

I struggled with getting it to work on multiple computers and have each of them set up to sync. I learned how to set it up effectively and now I can work from bot my desktop and my laptop. Well git is a terminal program that helps you upload, download and sync with remote servers. GutHub is a wesbite that allows sharing of work and ideas between coders. Version Control allows us the ability to have more control over our work. If we need to roll back to a previous point to fix an error, we can. Developers use version control as a safety precaution just in case something goes wrong or a big mistake is made that is hard to pinpoint. Everything makes sense.

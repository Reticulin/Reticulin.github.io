## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

First you will have to log into your GitHub account, if you don't have an account then you will have to make one. Once you are in your account, go ahead and create a new repository. You should now have a form to complete. Go ahead and name your repository and fill out the rest of the form. After that's done you can finish by creating the repository. Go into your repository and on the bottom right side you will see your repository's URL. Go ahead and click the "copy to clipboard" button". Now open your terminal and enter the following code to clone the repository to your local computer 
"git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORYNAME.github.io.git". Congratulations!! you created a repository on GutHub and then cloaned it to your local machine!

Open source means a code is open for others to change, add and do whatever they want to do with it.

I think in a world without the need of money; open source would just be another great part of a utopia, but even in this day and age, having open source is still good, but not for everything(developers still need to make a living).

Using licenses are like setting guidelines for your code. You can set how it's used and distributed.

I never knew there were that many different types of licenses. It was quite interesting to read about their differences and afterwards I can see why they were made. To allow the creator the flexibility to release their code the way they want.

I understood it enough that i did not need to refer to other resources.

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?



The researching wasn't too bad, it was just putting the words together to make it sound ok. I enjoyed it, however being on the time constraint of getting assignments done, made it stressful. This was very helpful to my learning since I spent hours trying to figure out my css. I would say it was cumbersome, just a long learning experience. I feel best about just getting it done and looking not too bland. I'm a little weary about getting it to show up as a webpage for others to see, so hopefully that works out.

I was asking myself,"What am i going to do this challenge on?". Also i needed to know more things that I could do with css, so I again used w3schools for their list of syntax used with css and just played around.

I am starting to get the flow of CSS, however my skills with it are still basic. I figured out how to correctly use "div" to help me out.

For new skills and tricks; I feel more confident and comfortable with css than I ever was.

I kept it simple due to my inexperience, but I wasn't exactly sure how to do the sidebar so I left that out. I'll have to have someone more experienced walk me through it.

I enjoyed the coding part. Once I had an idea, it was all fun from there.

The only tedious part was trying to find a topic to teach about. I wanted to pick something simple, yet interesting. I have an indecisive personality, so that made it hard to find and decide on a topic.

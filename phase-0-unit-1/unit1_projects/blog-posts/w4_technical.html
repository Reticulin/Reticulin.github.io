		Both languages boast their ease of use and great functionaility which would make some consider the differences. Both languages are solid. Both languages were created around the same time. They also are pretty easy to laern and pick up compared to other languages. Both languages are favored within the internet community and both have their own communities from which to gain information or help on their respective coding styles. Even though they have a good amount in common, they do have their differences.

		First we have Javascript that is a mostly if not all client side type of language. Being client side has its advantages and disadvantages. We know that being client side means showing and hiding elements dynamically, animations and validating forms. However being client side means that anybody can view your code and therefore is not good for things revolving around security. Now when we look at Ruby, we see that it's back end code which means it's server side. By being server side, it's more secure since in order to view the code, that person would need access to the server. When people think of web development, Javascript is almost always a must even in small amounts to do anything related to client side and it has recently started growing a good amount. When researching Javascript, there is a lot of rudimentary code that can come with bad advice, so it's best to be weary of whats right and whats wrong. Ruby on the other hand has a good amount of well written code out there to learn from and a very active community always willing to give their input. At the moment, many dev projects that want to be considered as "On the edge", use ruby as their coding languageof choice. Javascript whike being powerful doesnt offer much to the security aspect and in the world of today, that just doesn't cut it. Both languages will continue to gain speed, grow and evolve to become bigger and hopefully better entities to pave the way for the future of web development.

			I have to say that "Pandora" has been a faithful companion so to speak throughout the years. Nowadays it seems like I always have to be listening to music. "Pandora" helps me with that by providing music from whatever genre I would like to listen to at that moment. It's simplicity is incredible; once you make a free account, you just put in a song you like or a music genre and it will create a personalized station for you. "Pandora" is designed to try and learn from your votes, what music you like to listen to and then to offer just the type of music you want to listen to. On regular radio, you really have no choice of what you want to hear and what you don't want to hear. If you don't like a song that's playing you have to either wait it out or change the station; on "Pandora" all you have to do is give it a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Giving a song a thumbs up will tell "Pandora" that you like this song and it will play it more for you in the future. It will also check to see what attributes that song has and play song from other artist with the same attributes. Hitting the thumbs down button will immediately stop the song and play another song and try to avoid those attributes. It's an ingenious system and I have come to rely on "Pandora" a lot. For this website, I feel their pro and con are both the same. The con is that you can't pick what specific song you want to listen to and their pro is just that. Yea I can't pick that specific song I want to listen to, but there's youtube for that. What it's trying to do is to introduce you to new artists and bands. By learning from the thumbs up and down system, you should find that the bands it chooses for you are also enjoyable for you. Many people see it as a con, however to me it's a pro for this website. Another con is that you can only skip a certain amount of songs per hour (due to costs), but if you really hate a song and are out of skips, you can just go to another station and then go back to the one you were listening to. Having as many different stations as you want is a big pro since you will always be able to listen to exactly what you want to listen to. I recommend that people give "Pandora" a try and I'm sure you'll find it as awesome as I have.</p>

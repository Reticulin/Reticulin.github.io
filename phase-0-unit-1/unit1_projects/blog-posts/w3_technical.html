    <p> Javascript is one of the most popular languages out there. Why is it so popular? First off, Javascript is pretty easy to learn as compared to many other languages. Javascript is also fast and can reduce load on the server by being client side. It can also provide offline functionality. javascript is supported by every browser and can also used as your server side language. Also being so popular means that there is a huge community to find help from.
    </p>
    <p> While javascript is a very popular language, it is not perfect. It does not have multithreading capabilities and cannot access web pages hosted on a different domain. It can't access backend databases without server side script and cannot write to files on the server. Different browsers can interpret javascript differently so you will need to test your code across all major browsers before release. Due to many security issues, many users also disable javascript in their browsers.
    </p>
    <p> Despite it's faults, many people still choose to use Javascript due to its ease of use and strong qualities. Who knows? maybe one of these days it will be replaced by another language that doesnt have the weaknesses that javascript has.

		Classes are not those teaching sessions you go to school for, but are a way to model objects within a programming language such as Ruby. Classes are used to give attributes to an object. You can have a class create an object and also set descriptions for that object as I will point out here.

			Here we have just created the class 'Car' which will hold 3 objects to it, the make, model and price of the car. We will be able to create a new car listing while using those 3 arguments i.e "nicecar1 = Car.new('Lexus', 'ES350', 35000)". Now lets go create some instance methods!

			Now in the above picture we see that we added 2 new instance methods which are 'speed' and 'fun'. We can call out these instance methods after creating our class object, in this case being nicecar1. I've kept the arguments simple this time, but you can always make things for complex if you want. By entering "nicecar1.speed", you are calling out the 'speed' method which was created and what you'll get is it's argument which is "This car is fast enough.". Pretty cool huh?

			Classes can become what you want them to be from something simple as the car class we made or something as advanced as a board game. Ruby has taken classes to another level by making it easier to create and use. Use your imagination and the sky is the limit when it comes to creating things with classes. Thanks for reading!

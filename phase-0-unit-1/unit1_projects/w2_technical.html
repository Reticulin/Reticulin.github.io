			<p>Welcome to my blog on margins, borders and padding in css. I'm here to show you what the difference is between all 3 and show some examples to help you grasp how each one works. If you ever need to go back to a section for a refresher or to compare, the menu on the right will stay with you all the way so feel free to click which section you wish to go to. Lets begin shall we?

	<a NAME="Margins">
	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Margins</u></h2>
	</div>
<div class="ccontainer">
	<div class="content">
		<p>So first off, we will start with margins! Now margins are very simple to understand and anybody who has used "Microsoft Word" may know what margins are. When looking at a web page all we see is a bunch of content inside our browser. The browser acts like a container that holds all the content. Here are 2 colored boxes inside a browser
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="example">
		<img src="images/margin1.png"/>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="ccontainer">
	<div class="content">
		<p>As you saw in the previous picture, the boxes were hugging the left side of the screen. That is the default location for content when margins aren't specified, but by being specific, we can actually move the boxes to where we want them to be on the page or container they are in. I'm going to move the blue box a bit to the right using the syntax in css "margin-left:100px". By doing this command, it will put 100 pixels worth of space between the box and the left side of the browser.

</div> 

<a NAME="Borders">
<div class="sheader">
	<h2><u>Borders</u><h2>
</div>

<div class="ccontainer">
	<div class="content">
		<p>Now we come to borders. Borders are nothing more than outlines to either a container or some content. Borders can be useful for design purposes in order to give you a better idea of where all your objects and content fit on your web page. Our friendly colorful boxes will be helping us again. This time the red box will have a dashed outline created with the syntax "border-style:dashed" and "border-color:white" and "border-width:5px". Basically this will put a dashed outline around our boxy friend here that is white in color and 5 pixels thick. We can't leave the blue box out of the fun, so he's going to help too. I feel our friend "blue" is a little sharp around the edges so we're going to round him off a bit by using the syntax "border-radius:20px". This command will round off the edges by 20 pixels.
		</p>

	<div class="example">
		<img src="images/border1.png"/>

</div>

<a NAME="Padding">
<div class="sheader">
	<h2><u>Padding</u></h2>
</div>
<div class="ccontainer">
	<div class="content">
		<p>Finally we have padding. Now padding is going to be the amount of space between objects or content within their respective containers. Now the text within the boxes seems to be a little cramped. So by using padding, I can give them some room. I'm going to add the syntax "padding:50px" to the div section on my css. This will cause both boxes to expand away from the text by 50 pixels. It looks like the text can breath easy now.

			<p>So I'm here to give my thoughts on Dev Bootcamp's teaching and learning processes. After watching the fireside chat video, many things became clear to me. The isntructors at DBC sincerely want you to learn and succeed. They are patient and always willing to answer cohort questions. The mentality in DBC seems to be almost family oriented. We are all together and we must work together to succeed. We need to look out for each other no matter the skill level. I must admit I was worried after seeing so many people with Master's degrees and PHd's, but now I feel more calm and collected. We are a single unit that works together to move forward. Everyone must do their part and help out the other, for if we were to ignore or turn against each other, we would never progress. I'm eager to learn and eager to work with my peers. I feel there is much to learn not from just the DBC program, but from others experiences and expertise as well. Looking forward to working with everyone!

				Growing up, I was a heavy user of "Blockbuster". I used to go there to rent movies and video games for myself all the time. When "Netflix" came along, I was intrigued. I asked myself if they would succeed and if they would be able to meet the demands of the masses. After some time, I saw that "Netflix" still existed and was going strong. Being the curious person I am, I decided to take a look and maybe subscribe to what they offer. When first going on their site, you have to make an account to access their movies. I decided that I would just jump into it and sign up for a subscription, if I didn't like it I could always cancel. I have been with "Netflix" since then. When entering the site, you are bombarded with movie covers from so many genre's. They seem to want to cater to as many audiences as they can. They were big on the movie delivery and it was quite impressive. Depending on your type of subscription (mine was stream and have 1 movie at a time), you could ask them for a movie and they would send it to you by the next day if you could not stream it over the internet. Next day delivery is pretty impressive, especially on the massive scale it operates on. Once you finished with that movie you could send it back (no postage required) and they would send you the next movie on your list. The website is very user friendly and very easy to navigate. It's never really hard to find the movie you're looking for, however since streaming has become big, it's sad to sometimes see that the movie you want to watch is rental only. No worries though, if you're willing to wait till the next day to watch it. To be honest, I've never had to deal with their customer service because I've never had a problem. Not many cons I can see to this great website other than lacking in some movies to stream. I don't blame them due to the costs of it so its a light con. I hope "Netflix" goes on to be bigger and continue to serve their loyal customer base. </p>

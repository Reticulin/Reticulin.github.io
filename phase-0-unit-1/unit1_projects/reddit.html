		<p>I first discovered "Reddit" when I was watching a video game stream. The player I was watching, was constantly going on reddit whenever he had a free moment to read what it had to offer. I grew curious and decided to check out "Reddit" for myself and I quickly found myself addicted. The layout and design was simple, yet effective. Incredibly easy to navigate and with people constantly posting, you never ran out of material to keep you occupied. Another great thing about this site is that it has many different sections called "subreddits". These subreddits can range from cooking to financial advice. "Reddit" has grown a lot over the years and with growth comes some cons. Not everyone in the reddit community is helpful or friendly. There are also those who will try to lead you in the wrong direction on purpose just for a laugh. All in all, it's a great website that anyone can pick up and easily navigate to find what interests you. Just learn how to determine between  those trying to help you and those trying to lead you in the wrong direction.</p>

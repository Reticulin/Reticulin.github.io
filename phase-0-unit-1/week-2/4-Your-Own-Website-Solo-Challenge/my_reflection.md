# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: reticulin.github.io/phase-0-unit-1/unit1_projects/p&m.html

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

Learned how to make my webpage more responsive to the changing resolutions to make the user experience better when viewing the website. Also learned how to keep a menu fixed into position so a user can get to where they want to go at any time without having to scroll all the way back up.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

To be honest, I hate design and wireframe. I love the coding though and making an idea or design become a reality.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

Coming up with a design idea is always the hardest, after I get the idea, however, the coding is fun for me to do and enjoyable. Just had trouble getting my fonts to scale with a really small screen, but I think I know how to fix it now.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

I skipped it because it didn't interest me that much, but I would have added short descriptions about each person and given my thoughts about why they were chosen to be on our currency.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

Once I've learned it, it gets pretty simple. Sometimes I need to go back to where I learned something for a quick refresher. I found the "fixed menu" idea pretty cool and useful.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Other than the resources given to me by you guys, only w3schools.

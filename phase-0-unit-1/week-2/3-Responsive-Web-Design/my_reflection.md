# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
----- It's making a web page properly viewable no matter what device or resolution. It's a very good practice since it makes things easier to read for the user and it makes the web page look like it's supposed to look.
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
-----Smartphones and tablets have changed things due to different operating systems with different browsers and different resolutions. I think new technology will chnage web design, how? I don't know, but things always change.
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
-----They view the web through sound. Having an option for a page to read itself to them would be very helpful for the visually impaired. We should design and develop for them because they have the same rights as we do to use the world wide web.
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
I don't really understand how grids work and what they really are. Making a webpage properly viewable across different platforms has resonated with me. It's something that most people overlook when they browse a website, especially on their phone or tablet.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I just used the resources given to me by you guys at DBC. They were informative and simple to understand. Also being able to use quirktools to check my work was a great resource and allowed me to finish this assignment efficiently.

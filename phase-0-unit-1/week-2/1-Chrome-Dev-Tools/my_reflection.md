# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
I'm afraid to say I'm confused with explanations on DOM. I will need to ask someone more experienced to maybe help me understand, either with anaologies or just translating to laymans terms.
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
I just compared between the CSS pages. I wanted to see what else I could do with CSS and how I could possibly implement it on my own web pages.
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
It's a very intriguing tool. I look forward to getting good with it as it seems to make things much easier.
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
I always knew insepcting elements would show you the page's code, but now with dev tools, I can make modifcations easily and it doesnt feel as foreign to me as before.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
No other resources this time other than google's own handbook and guide for dev tools.

# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
----- I really have no feeling yet either way about web standards. 
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
------ It kind of makes sense and it kind of doesnt. I'll need some extra clarification on the subject.
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
----- I would have to use HTML5 more often to see if I would like the new elements. It's unfamiliar to me since I'm used to regular HTML, but hopefully I can get a feel for it if I work on it more.
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
----- I would say it allows you to work with a blank slate and not have any unwanted styling from different browsers and such.
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
-----I've used opera, chrome, firefox and IE and the only time I see differences are really on IE.
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
-----Stackoverflow was a good resource for some of the questions that needed to be answered.

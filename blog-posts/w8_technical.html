			Web security is as it sounds. Being secure while on the web/internet. You would be surprised if you knew how many people actually don't practice safe browsing habits on the internet. The net is a wonderful place with vast abouts of knowledge, information, entertainment and a means of communication. There are those that feel that they can browse the internet and do what they want and no harm can come to them or their computer. If you are one of those people, I strongly recommend that you continue reading this blog.

			There is a balance in all things and with all the good things that the internet offers, it has it's fair share of bad things as well. There are malicious websites that only need you to visit them in order to put malware and adware onto your computer without you knowing. There can be viruses, worms and trojans hiding in attachments within your emails. You could have a keylogger recording all the buttons you press on your keyboard and sending that information to another person to use maliciously. You could be on a shopping website that you think is a good deal, when in reality, there are no products and you just paid someone money for a product that you will never receive. There are so many threats on the internet today and these threats can actually cripple your lives, so it's best to be aware and know how to defend against and prevent these things from happening to you.

		<p>Now to teach you how to protect you from and prevent malicious activity on your computer. First you must be aware of emails and websites that offer something that is too good to be true, because 99% of the time, it is. Whenever someone emails you, asking you to wire them money, it's a scam. When buying things from the internet; unless you are using a well known website such as Amazon.com, Newegg.com or any retailer website like Bestbuy.com or Radioshack.com, you must research it. It's very simple, all you have to do is type in the website in google and put the word "scam" after it. You will be given a bunch of links that lead you to reviews on the website from other people. These reviews are essential as they will tell you the legitimacy of the website you want to spend money on. Now we come to the unseen threats that may plague your computer such as malware and viruses. Malware has been an enemy I have battled since I was in the 8th grade. I have used a wide range of protection and cleaning software ranging from McAfee and Norton to Microsoft Security Essentials so you can rest assured that I know what I'm talking about. Currently the best software you can get that's free is Malwarebytes which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org">Malwarebytes.org</a>. This piece of software has been essential in helping me clean other's computers as well as my own and I recommend it to everyone as it's free and very effective. As for an active virus protection service, I don't recommend buying malwarebytes since their license is only good for one use so I feel it is not worth it. Two choices for free active virus protection would be between <a href="www.avg.com">AVG</a> and <a href="www.avast.com">Avast</a>. Check those out and be safe!

		<p>Most people will believe that there is no wrong way to ask a question and most of the times that can be true, but I would like to explain the more efficient way to ask a question. Sometimes when people ask a question, they don't have their thoughts gathered and can't present their question very well. When this happens, the person answering the question will have a harder time finding an answer that pleases that person. Make sure you have your thoughts together before asking a question. You also want your question to be short and sweet, meaning that the question should be kept short and specific. By doing this, you will likely get your question answered quickly with the information that you wanted to know.

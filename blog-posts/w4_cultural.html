		How many of us are comfortable with putting our information out on the internet? Most of us do that willingly and those who are not willing still end up with their information on the internet in someone else's hands. With the boom in the web industry and how fast things are progressing, people are thinking more about business than security. Take the hacker group "Anonymous" who may be teenagers or young adults for all we know, but somehow they can cause a lot of security issues throughout the internet without much resistance. I feel the internet is still something we think we can control, but cannot. new security issues pop up everday from viruses to back doors within a program or website. The answer to the question, "Are we secure?" is, "No, we are not.".

		Knowing that we're insecure was the obvious part, but how do we fix that? I'm not saying this will be easy, but good security habits may need to start being taught in schools. There needs to be an understanding between coders and programmers. Coders and programmers need to work to make THEIR code secure before releasing it. Most of the times it can be just negligence or laziness that causes these backdoors or vulnerabilities. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that there needs to be some free education in terms of cyber security. When something is free, no matter what it is, it grabs people's attention and that is how we can easily teach everyone safe practices and prevention. Those who are gifted in programming should find ways or write programs that make it easier to scan code for vulnerabilities and back doors. I'm happy we have those who work towards protecting against viruses and worms, but we may need to go deeper and have a program that protects from bad code being released. It's up to present and future coders to try and change the way we look at cyber security.

			During the first week of DBC, I was a little shy and didn't really want to pair with anyone. After finding out that it's pretty much expected, I had no choice but to jump in and start pairing. I was nervous at first, but everyone that I have paired with were so friendly and understanding that it made it easier. Working back and forth with one another in order to solve challenges was fun and rewarding. Before I was scared of continuing on to campus and doing group projects, but now I can hardly wait. Things can get frustrating at times since sometimes I need some quiet to figure out a problem and your partner may be going through their thought process aloud. I'm sure that can bother a lot of people, but luckily my train of thought doesn't break that easily so I find it only a minor inconvenience. All in all I enjoy pairing and hope to also enjoy working with a group on bigger projects.

		<p>
			I know feed back is an important part of this bootcamp, but it can be scary wondering what others think of you sometimes. I'm always nervous to read feedback because these aren't just strangers; they are my future collegues. The feedback is helpful in being a reality check for things about me that I don't realize. Sometimes it can be hard to analyze yourself, so it's always good to have an outside opinion. The next time I pair, I will have to be more open with my thoughts and share more about my thought process along the way. Writing feedback is especially hard for me since I don't know what to say. All my pairing sessions feel more like conversation from friend to friend with coding on the side. I honestly don't care about someone's level of knowledge and as long as they are friendly and eager to learn as I am, I consider it a great session. I'm a person that needs to work with someone more in depth to be able to give feedback on their performance. Maybe that personw as having a bad day or maybe they just weren't in the zone that one time. Until I pair with someone multiple times, I won't be able to gauge their true skill and knowledge.

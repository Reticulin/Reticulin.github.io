			Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. Basically determining somebody's worth by looking at either their appearance or most commonly, their race. The term was started in 1995 by Steele and Aronson who conducted several experiments in order to prove that stereotype threat is a very real concept.

		<h2><u>My Experience</u></h2>

		<p>
			Growing up, I lived in the east bay around Oakland, CA, but went to school in San Francisco. My parents had wanted me to go to this private school in San Francisco rather than a public school near our house. The thing about going to this school was that I was one of two caucasian kids at this school whereas the rest were of chinese descent. Being a little kid, it made no difference to me and I never really thought about it. I ended up going to high school at this private school as well and that's when I experienced something that I thought was unfair. Freshman year I was having trouble in a math class with this new teacher who had never taught before. I was struggling and would even spend my afternoons in his classroom trying to learn the homework and get it done. After all the time spent trying my hardest, we come to the end of the school year. The teacher had decided to fail me and when I had gone with my mom to dispute this grade he said he could have passed me, but decided to teach me a lesson instead. To this day, I do not understand why he did that to me, but it ruined me for math for the rest of high school. Perhaps it was because I was the only white student or maybe he just didnt like me, but I believe its the former. That was my experience with stereotype threat and how it hurt my performance and progression all throughout high school. To be honest it can be hard to notice stereotype threat sometimes, but I believe that it's our job to discourage it and make a mention of it when we think it may be ocurring. Equality is important and we are all human and all bring different strengths to the table. Treating everyone equal can only benefit us as a society and I hope that in the future stereotype threat will be extinct and forgotten.

		<p>
			The language of Ruby has a good amount of different variables that can be used in many different situations depending on what you're trying to code. There are global variables whose name begin with "$", instance variables whose name begins with "@", local variables whose name begins with "[a-z]" or "_", constants whose name starts with "[A-Z]" and class variables whose name starts with "@@".

	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Global Variables</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			Global variables are pretty straightforward as their name speaks for themselves. Being global means they can be called anytime throughout the code, but that's not really a good thing. Global variables are generally discouraged due to that fact since they can also be changed from anywhere within the code which can make finding bugs difficult.

  <a NAME="Class">
	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Class Variables</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			Class variables are shared amongst all instances of a class. One variable value exists for all objects instantiated from that class. They are basically global variables limited to the class they are in.

	</div>

	</div>
  <a NAME="Instance">
	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Instance Variables</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			Instance variables are pretty similar to class variables except their values remain local to specific instances of an object. Each object within the class gets its own local copy of that instance variable.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
	</div>
  <a NAME="Local">
	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Local Variables</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			Local variables are local to the code construct they are within. If a local variable is within a method or a loop then it stays within that method or loop and can't be accessed from outside the method or loop.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="container">
	</div>
  <a NAME="Constants">
	<div class="sheader">
		<h2><u>Constants</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			Constants are values that can be changed, but probably should not be. Constants declared within a class or module can be available anywhere within the context of that same class or module. Constants that are declared outside of a class or module are given the global scope status.

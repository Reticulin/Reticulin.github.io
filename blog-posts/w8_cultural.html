		<h2><u>Sources of Conflict</u></h2>

		<p>
			There can be varying sources of conflict, 6 of them being poor communication, different values, differing interests, scarce resources, personality clashes and poor performance. These sources are generally found in the workplace where everyone is unique and may not share the same interests or goals. Something as simple as miscommunication can sometimes cause some major misunderstandings between others and thus cause conflict. Also let's look at each individual's personality. We all have our own minds and we all think differently. There may be people who share some of our interests, but not all and that's what makes us humans unique. However being unique can mean conflict when someone doesn't share our opinion or our ideas and mannerisms. When meeting new people or working with others, we must try to remain open minded and try to resolve conflicts before they happen, but keep in mind that no matter how hard we try, conflicts will still happen. It's up to us to learn how to resolve those conflicts to better work together.

		<h2><u>Resolution</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			There are a good amount of methods to address conflict, 5 of them being avoidance(trying to avoid the conflict and hoping it goes away), collaboration(when you work together to find a mutual solution), compromise(when you try to find the middle ground), competing(where you compete and may the best person win) and accomodation(surrending our own needs and wishes to please the other person). Most of the time I would probably avoid the competing conflict as it may bring others into the conflict. Generally I find that compromise is the best solution since it makes it equal for both parties. If you find you are the bigger person you may also favor the accomodation method. Sometimes it's just not worth it to fight or argue over so giving in can be a quick solution to the conflict at hand. These are just my opinions, so choose whatever method feels most comfortable for you.

		<h2><u>My Experience</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			I would like to share with you one of my experiences if you so wish to read about it. This experience was not really work related(I did work with this person), but related to friendships within the group I hang out with. We'll call this friend of mine Bob. Now Bob had been hanging out with us for quite some time and we were all good friends. We always enjoyed hanging out and having a good time, whether it be movies or video games, it was always fun. Well one day Bob had a conflict with someone else within our group of friends; let's call him Jack. Bob and Jack had a serious conflict between each other of which I will not mention, but it was causing tension throughout our whole group so I decided to step in and try to guide them to a resolution. Both were very angry with the other and probably didn't want to listen to me. I first tried to use the compromise method between the two. I first took the method to Jack who was reluctant at first, eventually agreed to compromise, but Bob, on the other hand, was not having any of it. Bob was holding on to anger and it seemed that he did not want a resolution. I tried something risky in asking Jack to accomodate Bob. After being rejected from compromise the first time, Jack was reluctant, but came around and tried to accomodate Bob. Bob stood his ground and didn't budge one bit. Bob decided to leave the group due to a small conflict which shocked us all. At that point the only method left was avoidance. The group went on and to this day Bob hasn't returned, but things look promising. I see him sometimes and we shoot the breeze a little bit. Hopefully someday he will decide to return to the group.

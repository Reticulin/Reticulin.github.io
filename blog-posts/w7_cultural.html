		<h2><u>Values of My Life</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			There have been two major values that have driven my life and those two values are "Honor" and "Respect". Some people may think that those two values are the same thing, but they are not. Honor for me satnds for loyalty and standing up for what is right. Respect is for treating others well regardless of race or religion. In general I do my best to live up to both these values everyday and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			The last time someone asked me for advice was on a friends relationship. I had to stress to this person that you must be completely open with your partner. While honesty and openess may be a hard thing to do, it greatly benefits your relationship in the future. By being open with your partner, you grow trust and with trust, your relationship has a solid foundation from which it can grow.

		<h2><u>Me and Stereotypes</u></h2>
	</div>

	<div class="content">
		<p>
			I feel that my values do a good job of preventing me from stereotyping others, however it does bother me when someone stereotypes myself. Nobody likes to be discriminated against in any way so if I have an opportunity to stop it and open some minds in the process, I'll do it. Whenever I'm feeling down or stuck on something, I take some time and do something that I enjoy whether its playing a video game or watching a movie to raise my spirits.

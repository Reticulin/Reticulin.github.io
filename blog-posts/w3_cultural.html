    <div class="content">
    	<p>After taking the personal thinking style test, I had found that I have 2 styles of thinking. I have both an Abstract Random and an Abstract Sequential style of thinking. I'm going to go over both styles and give both their strengths and their weaknesses.

    	<h2><u>Abstract Random Style</u></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
    	<p>So first off, we have the Abstract Random style of thinking. Abstract Random thinkers organize information through reflection, and thrive in unstructured, people oriented enviroments. Being abstract random means that I like to listen to others, bring stability to group situations, can establish a healthy relationship with others and is good at focusing on the issues at hand. I can learn my best when I have my own space, have broad guidelines, able to keep a friendly relationship and able to participate with my group. I do have a hard time explaining my feelings and I dislike competition. I don't like to be held down or restricted in terms of my enviroment and I have trouble accepting any criticism (even positive). At times I even find it hard to concentrate on one thing, I always have to stop and come back to something after awhile.

    	<h2><u>Abstract Sequential Style</u></h2>
    </div>

    <div class="content">
    	<p>I am also a strong Abstract Sequential thinker. I love the world of theory and abstract thought. I enjoy putting together scenarios in my head for all situations and it's moreso like an instinct. I'm a person who needs to be heard when I feel I know whats going on. I always take the time to analyze a situation before I jump into it. When making a decision, i refer heavily to logic. I prefer to work alone and around things that I find stimulating. I like having more experienced people I can go to for help pr examples. I simply hate repetivity and feel like it's a waste of my time. There are also times where I will monopolize a conversation which makes it difficult to work with others.

		<p>After reading about the growth and fixed mindset from the beginning of DBC, I realize that now is the time to take those weaknesses and turn them into strengths to better work with not only myself, but with my fellow coders. My biggest problem at the moment is pairing with others during other assignments. I enjoy working by myself, but I enjoy the company of others. I will have to merge the two in order to work better with my fellow cohorts. Working solo has the advantage of a peaceful enviroment, but lacks the insight of others. If I can get better with pairing and be less shy, I can gain other perspectives and learn new skills through others. I also believe that meditation will also be helpfyul for me in terms of concentration. If I can calm my mind, i should be able to concentrate on one thing only and be more productive. The instructors and the cohorts here at DBC have been very friendly and helpful, so I have the utmost confidence that I will be able to get rid of these weaknesses with their help. Thanks for reading!
